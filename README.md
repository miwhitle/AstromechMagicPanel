# Astromech Magic Panel (AMP)

This project covers how to build and animate a LED-based Magic Panel for Astromech (R2-D2) droids. The provided sketch cycles through 8 predefined color pallets at 30 second intervals. The colors, intervals, sequences, speed, and density are all configurable. 

The default color sequence is:

 - Red, *\<Off\>*
 - Red with hints of Blue
 - Blue, *\<Off\>*
 - Red with hints of White
 - White, *\<Off\>* 
 - Blue with hints of White
 - Blue, *\<Off\>*
 - Rainbow, *\<Off\>*

## Getting Started

To build the Astromech Magic Panel (AMP) you will need the following hardware:

 - 1 x [Adafruit QT Py (SAMD21)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600)
 - 2 x [Adafruit DotStar 8x8 Grid](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3444) or [SparkFun LuMini LED Matrix - 8x8](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15047) (Sparkfun is easier to solder)
 - 8 x M3, 6mm screws
 - USB Type-C Cable supporting both Data and Power 
 - Soldering Iron and Solder
 - The [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
 - A 3D printer or the ability to print the included mounting brackets

**Note:** You will also need a semi-transparent Magic Panel. If 3D printing this panel I recommend printing the panel *vertically* using a clear PETG filament. I used 6 perimeters/shells with 10% gyroid infill. Fewer perimeters and less infill will result in poorer LED diffusion.

### Step 1: Solder (tbd)
### Step 2: Program (tbd)
### Step 3: Print (tbd)
### Step 4: Assemble (tbd)
